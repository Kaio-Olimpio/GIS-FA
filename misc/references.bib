	abstract = {Genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) is a major concern in tropical maize breeding. Here, we used factor analytic mixed models (FAMM) to study GEI in a tropical maize dataset. Our goal was to select high-performance and stable hybrids using factor analytic selection tools (FAST) derived from FAMM outputs. Because the dataset comprised two different planting seasons, we also investigated differences in the genetic gains between seasonal and general selection (i.e., for both seasons simultaneously). The trials were installed in a lattice design with 36 hybrids containing two replicates and blocks with six plants each. We evaluated 53 hybrids and seven checks in 48 environments, represented by a combination of locations, years and seasons. We fitted the FAMMs with distinct sets of factors. The best-fitted FAMM was selected considering a parsimony-explained variance balance. Using the best FAMM for both seasonal and general analyses, we estimated the following selection tools: overall performance (OP); root mean square deviation (RMSD), which represents general stability; and responsiveness , which represents specific stability. We selected hybrids based on an index built with OP and RMSD. Five and three hybrids were selected considering both general and seasonal analyses for the first and second season, respectively. Two hybrids were amongst the top eight for both seasonal analyses (i.e., only first season and only second season simultaenously). Higher genetic gains may be obtained by employing FAMM and using FAST in each season rather than analysing both seasons in a joint fashion.},

	abstract = {Theobroma grandiflorum is a perennial fruit tree native to the Amazon region. As a perennial species with continuous production throughout the years, breeders should seek well-conducted trials, accurate phenotyping and adequate statistical models for genetic evaluation and selection that can leverage the information provided by the repeated measures. We evaluated 13 models with different covariance structures for genetic and residual effects for T. grandiflorum evaluation, using an unbalanced dataset with 34 hybrids from the triple-crossing of nine parents, planted in a randomized complete block design. For nine consecutive years, the fruit yield of these hybrids was evaluated. Each model had its goodness-of-fit tested by the Akaike information criterion. The most adequate model for estimating the variance components and the breeding values were modelled with the first-order heterogeneous autoregressive for residual effects and third-order factor analytic for genetic effects. From this model, we used the factor analytic selection tools for selecting the top 10 families, providing a genetic gain of 10.42\%. These results are important not only for T. grandiflorum breeding but also to show that in any repeated measures’ data from fruit-bearing perennial species the modelling of genetic and residual effects should not be neglected.},

A spatial linear mixed model that includes a multiplicative mixed model (MMM) for the variety by environment (V×E) effect has been used for the analysis of 39 trials of 25 historical lupin varieties for the period of 1997 to 2006. The 25 varieties were produced by the Australian breeding effort from 1967 to 2007 and are a result from five cycles of breeding. Genetic gain was assessed on the basis of the overall performance of the varieties across all environments based on the MMM results. The genetic gain from the first early flowering variety, Unicrop, to the highest yielding variety, Mandelup, represents a yield gain of 81\% over 31 yr. The varieties’ yield stability across the environments and their broad or specific adaptations are discussed.},

Whereas goodness of fit measures such as the coefficient of determination (R2) or the adjusted R2 are well established for linear models, it is not obvious how such measures should be defined for generalized linear and mixed models. There are by now several proposals but no consensus has yet emerged as to the best unified approach in these settings. In particular, it is an open question how to best account for heteroscedasticity and for covariance among observations present in residual error or induced by random effects. This paper proposes a new approach that addresses this issue and is universally applicable for arbitrary variance-covariance structures including spatial models and repeated measures. It is exemplified using three biological examples.},
